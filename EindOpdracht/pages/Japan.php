            <p>The famous Sagano Bamboo Grove in Kyoto, along with the torii ‚õ©Ô∏è of Fushimi Inari Taisha or the Ginkaku-ji, is certainly one of Japan‚Äôs most iconic places.<br>
            Its popularity actually reaches far beyond the frontiers of Japan, and it is often listed as one of the most beautiful or must-see-before-you-die places on earth.<br><br>
            There is good cause for this: although it is not the only bamboo grove in the Kyoto area, it is probably the largest and walking through it is like escaping to another world.<br> 
            Crowds of tourists therefore flock to this wonderful site on a daily basis. A single narrow path runs through the grove from east to west, covering a distance of about 500 meters, and taking photos of the site without anyone on them has become something of a challenge.<br><br>

            The hardest thing is to attune one's ear to the sound of the breeze gently breathing between the trees and the high treetops gently swaying in the light wind.<br> 
            The sun shines through the very dense grove in the midst of immense, often thick-trunked trees.<br> 
            There is a unique atmosphere to this place to which no photo can do complete justice.
            In May 2018, the managing company of the bamboo forest raised the alarm as more than a hundred bamboo trees were defaced over the last two previous months by foreign tourists who engraved their names on the trunks (especially in English and in Korean).<br> 
            Such behavior greatly endangers the trees and the beauty of the scenery.<br> 
            Large green masking tapes have been placed to try to hide the damages but the result is unfortunately inelegant.<br>
            In Japan, bamboo trees are a symbol of strength believed to keep evil spirits at bay.<br> 
            This probably explains why the entrance to Tenryu-ji is located at one end of the grove and the entrance to Okochi-Sanso Villa at the other end.<br>
            And when you are visiting the area around the bamboo grove, whether on foot, by bike üö≤ or in a rickshaw, you will probably come across other equally magical landscapes.
