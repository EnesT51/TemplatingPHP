            Yet it still manages to ranks highly for both peace and quality of life.<br>
            Theft and other felonies, the National Police Agency notes, have become passé.<br> 
            Over the past few years, the number of recorded crimes continued to decrease to historically low levels—a trend also reflected in the low incarceration rate,<br>
            which in Japan has followed a downward trajectory starting from the 1950s.<br><br>
            However, when it comes to relations with neighboring countries, rising tensions with China and North Korea are often mentioned by the Japanese as areas of concern.<br>
            Japan’s “peace constitution”—put in place following the Second World War to prohibit the resurrection of aggressive militarism—was reinterpreted in 2014 to enable “collective self-defense,”<br>
            which preceded a restructuring and build-up of the country’s military capabilities.<br>
            Low marks in the per-capita military expenditure and international conflict domains keep Japan far from the very top positions of the peace ranking.</p>";
